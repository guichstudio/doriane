# GTA V Style Prompt Reference — Doriane's Journey

## 1. Core GTA Style Block (Image Generation)

Copy-paste this into any FLUX.2 Pro prompt. Scene-agnostic — append your scene description after it.

THIS IS A GTA V / GTA IV IN-GAME SCREENSHOT. This is NOT a photograph. NOT photorealistic. NOT a render. This is GRAND THEFT AUTO captured directly from gameplay using Rockstar Editor or in-game screenshot tool.

GTA STYLE — THIS IS EVERYTHING. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS MORE THAN THIS:
- RAGE ENGINE RENDERING. The geometry is simplified — polygonal edges visible on objects, structures, environment. This is a video game, NOT reality.
- HEAVY FILM GRAIN. Not subtle — HEAVY. Visible noise/grain covering the entire frame like GTA IV's aggressive post-processing. Grain grain grain everywhere.
- GTA COLOR GRADING: desaturated, slightly washed out, warm yellow-orange tint on light sources, slightly crushed blacks, that signature Rockstar color look. Think GTA IV's grey-green-brown palette mixed with GTA V's warm tones.
- GAME TEXTURES: surfaces have that slightly tiled, repeating game texture look. Structures look like low-poly game assets. Clothing has simplified fabric textures — NOT photorealistic cloth simulation.
- COMPRESSED JPEG ARTIFACTS: this looks like it was screenshotted from a game and saved as compressed JPEG. Slight blockiness, slight banding in gradients.
- SHADOW MAPS: blocky, pixelated shadow edges — NOT smooth ray-traced shadows. GTA V shadow quality.
- LOD (Level of Detail): distant objects are simplified blocks, distant terrain has flat textures, water is a simple reflective plane with basic wave patterns.
- BLOOM: heavy bloom on light sources, chunky god rays, not subtle — the kind of bloom that GTA V is famous for.
- SLIGHT CHROMATIC ABERRATION at image edges.
- VIGNETTE: dark corners like GTA IV's heavy vignetting.
- The sky has that PAINTERLY, slightly banded quality — GTA V skies are gorgeous but obviously rendered, not photographic.
- Anti-aliasing artifacts visible — slight jaggies on edges of objects, characteristic of FXAA/MSAA in GTA V.

THIS MUST LOOK LIKE GTA V OR GTA IV. If someone sees this image they should IMMEDIATELY say "that's from GTA". The film grain, the textures, the color grading, the polygon geometry — everything screams VIDEO GAME. If it looks like a photo, YOU HAVE FAILED.

## 2. Core GTA Style Block (Video Animation)

For Kling 3.0 image-to-video prompts:

---

A GTA V in-game cutscene [SHOT TYPE]. [SCENE DESCRIPTION].
[MOTION DESCRIPTION — what moves, how the camera moves].
Heavy GTA V film grain throughout — visible noise across the entire frame.
RAGE engine textures, [warm saturated / desaturated nighttime] color grading [with neon glows / with golden hour warmth].
[Subtle bloom / Lens flare] on [light sources].
Slight chromatic aberration.
Cinematic camera movement — [smooth dolly / slow push-in / tracking follow / tilt up].
This looks like a GTA V gameplay recording — video game graphics, not photorealistic.

## 3. Camera Angles Library

### Third-Person Follow (most common)
Third-person GTA V gameplay camera positioned several meters BEHIND and slightly ABOVE the character — classic GTA V walking perspective.

### Wide Establishing
EXTREME zoom-out, GTA V cinematic camera mode. Character small in frame (10-25% of height). Full environment visible — stadium, buildings, landscape.

### Low-Angle Hero
Dynamic low-angle shot from ground level. Camera looking UP at character mid-stride — "hero walk" composition. Environment towers behind.

### Close-Up / Snapmatic
Low angle close-up, Snapmatic camera perspective. Tight framing on subject. Shallow depth of field — sharp subject, soft background with hexagonal game-engine bokeh.

### Aerial / Drone
Aerial overhead shot looking down at the scene. Character small below. Camera can tilt or rise during animation.

## 6. Video Animation Rules (Kling 3.0)

- Always start with "A GTA V in-game cutscene [shot type]"
- Always end with "This looks like a GTA V gameplay recording — video game graphics, not photorealistic"
- Always include "Heavy GTA V film grain throughout — visible noise across the entire frame"
- Keep camera movement specific: "tilts upward", "dollies forward", "pushes in", "is completely still"
- Describe motion sequentially — what happens first, then next
- Duration: 5 seconds standard

### Motion Types That Work
| Motion | Prompt Pattern |
|--------|---------------|
| Walk forward | "she walks slowly forward... hair sways gently in warm breeze" |
| Camera push-in | "Slow cinematic camera push-in toward [subject]... golden sunset light shifts" |
| Camera dolly | "Slow cinematic camera dolly forward along [path]" |
| Camera tilt up | "Camera smoothly tilts upward and rises, following [subject]" |
| Look around | "she turns slowly, looking over her shoulder... wind catches her hair" |

## 7. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- "Photorealistic" — kills the GTA look instantly
- "Unreal Engine" — wrong engine, different aesthetic
- "Cartoon" or "illustration" — too far from GTA's semi-realistic style
- "Subtle grain" — grain must be HEAVY
- "Ray-traced shadows" — GTA V uses shadow maps (blocky, pixelated)
- Forgetting film grain — single biggest differentiator
